# Typography vs. Calligraphy

### Creation:
- **Calligraphy** is hand-drawn.
- **Typography** uses pre-designed fonts.

### Flexibility:
- **Calligraphy** is fluid and personal.
- **Typography** is consistent and uniform.

### Purpose:
- **Calligraphy** is decorative and artistic.
- **Typography** is for communication and legibility.

#### Example:
- **Calligraphy**: A hand-written wedding invitation
- **Typography**: Body text in a website font like Helvetica.

# Types of Fonts

### **Serif**
- Fonts with small decorative lines (serifs) at the ends of letter strokes (e.g., Times New Roman).
### **Sans-Serif**
- Fonts without decorative strokes, offering a clean, modern look (e.g., Helvetica).
### **Monospace**
- Fonts where each letter takes up the same width, often used in coding (e.g., Courier).
### **Display**
- Fonts designed for large headings, decorative, and attention-grabbing (e.g., Impact).
### **Script**
- Fonts that mimic cursive handwriting with connected, flowing letters (e.g., Brush Script).
### **Handwritten**
- Fonts that resemble natural handwriting, often casual and informal (e.g., Comic Sans).

# Type Properties

![Anatomy_of_a_Typeface.png|500](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XN6ATtQ7Q_NxH5Eb_ZMiAZI6Wh61nClqWKHyx10vhIly8lzEOKmswVEAxjQOzldyCJ_q5W6dTznM0fn5wS8ArPzhpDq4vfhUxnOz=w1064-v0)

### **Cap Height**

- **Cap height** refers to the height of a typeface’s flat capital letters (such as M or I) measured from the baseline.

### **X-height**

- **X-height** refers to the height of the lowercase x for a typeface, indicating how tall or short each glyph in a typeface will be.

### **Serif**

- The small decorative stroke or line added to the ends of the main strokes in certain fonts.

### **Letter Spacing**

- Also called tracking, refers to the uniform adjustment of the space between letters in a piece of text.

### **Baseline**

- The **baseline** is the invisible line upon which a line of text rests.

### **Descender & Ascender**

- **Ascenders** are the upward vertical strokes found in certain lowercase letters that extend above the x-height.
- **Descenders** are downward strokes that extend below the baseline.

### **Leading**

- Line height, also known as leading, controls the amount of space between baselines in a block of text.

### **Weight**

- The relative thickness of a font’s stroke, with common weights being Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold.

### **Stress**

- The direction of the width in the curved stroke of a letter.

# Italic

### **Italic vs. Slanted**

- **Italic** changes the font and tends to occupy less space.
- **Slanted** slants the current font without altering its structure.

#### **Fun Fact**:

- The book _Lusíadas_ is written only in Italic because it was cheaper.

# Text Alignment

### **Flush Left (Ragged Right)**
- **Advantages**: Natural reading flow, good for large text blocks.
- **Disadvantages**: Uneven right edge can appear inconsistent.
- **Use Cases**: Books, articles, newspapers.

### **Flush Right (Ragged Left)**
- **Advantages**: Visually distinctive, useful for captions and side notes.
- **Disadvantages**: Harder to read for long text blocks.
- **Use Cases**: Image captions, pull quotes, posters.

### **Justified**
- **Advantages**: Creates a clean, structured look.
- **Disadvantages**: Uneven word spacing can cause readability issues (rivers of white space).
- **Use Cases**: Magazines, newspapers, formal documents.

### **Centered**
- **Advantages**: Symmetrical and formal.
- **Disadvantages**: Difficult to read in long passages.
- **Use Cases**: Invitations, poetry, posters.

# Grids

### **Definition**
- A grid is a system of horizontal and vertical lines that organize content on a page.

### **Types of Grids**
1. **Manuscript Grid**
    - **Advantages**: Simple and effective for long-form text.
    - **Disadvantages**: Not flexible for complex layouts.
    - **Use Cases**: Books, academic papers, novels.
2. **Column Grid**
    - **Advantages**: Allows structured yet flexible layouts.
    - **Disadvantages**: Can become rigid if not used creatively.
    - **Use Cases**: Newspapers, magazines, blogs.
3. **Modular Grid**
    - **Advantages**: Highly organized and versatile.
    - **Disadvantages**: Requires careful planning to avoid excessive rigidity.
    - **Use Cases**: Websites, complex editorial designs, product catalogs.
4. **Hierarchical Grid**
    - **Advantages**: Provides a dynamic, organic feel.
    - **Disadvantages**: Requires experience to maintain balance and readability.
    - **Use Cases**: Websites, posters, presentations.

### **Baseline Grid**
- A consistent grid that uses the baseline to align text across multiple columns.
# Size and Scale

### **Traditional Measurement**
- The pica system was used historically for typesetting.
### **Scale Contrast**
- Strong contrast between type sizes enhances design dynamism.
# Font Classification

### **Serif**
- **Humanist**: Inspired by traditional calligraphy, warm and readable. _Use Cases_: Books, long-form text.
- **Modern**: High contrast, thin serifs. _Use Cases_: Luxury branding, formal documents.
- **Transitional**: Balance between humanist and modern. _Use Cases_: Newspapers, editorial content.
- **Slab Serif**: Thick, block-like serifs. _Use Cases_: Posters, headlines, branding.

### **Sans-Serif**
- **Humanist**: Organic, calligraphic influence. _Use Cases_: Signage, human-centered design.
- **Modern**: Geometric, clean. _Use Cases_: Tech branding, corporate identity.
- **Transitional**: Balance between geometric and organic. _Use Cases_: UI design, digital media.

### **Types of Classification**
- Vox System

# Some History of Typography

### **Renaissance (15th Century)**

- Revival of Roman-style typefaces with refined proportions.
- **Humanist Fonts**: Based on calligraphic writing, highly readable.
- **Roman du Roi**: Designed with geometric precision for the French press.

### **Baskerville (18th Century)**

- Fine, high-contrast letterforms that improved printing quality.
- Led to innovations in paper and ink production.

#### **Fun Fact**

- Arial was created as a Helvetica alternative to avoid licensing fees.

# Typography and Industrialization (19th Century)

- The rise of advertising led to bold, attention-grabbing typefaces.
- **Fat Faces**: Extra-bold fonts with exaggerated proportions.
- **Slab Serif**: Heavy, block-like serifs (misleadingly called "Egyptian").
- Shift from lead to **wood type** for larger letters in printing.

### **1980s and Digital Typography**

- Early computer fonts were pixelated (e.g., bitmap fonts in calculators).
- Designers like **Zuzana Licko** adapted fonts to digital grids.
- Laser printing improved resolution, enabling high-quality digital typography.

# Postmodern Typography (1990s)

- **Typographic experimentation**: Deconstructed, chaotic, expressive designs.
- **Edward Fella**: Designed unconventional, artistic letterforms.
- **Barry Deck**: Created _Template Gothic_, a grunge-style font.

# Computational Typography (21st Century)

- Algorithmic, generative, and interactive fonts.
- **Beowolf** (Erik van Blokland & Just van Rossum): Introduced randomness in letterforms.
- Search: **Computational Design and Visualization Lab**.
