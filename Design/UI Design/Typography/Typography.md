## Cap Height
- **Cap height** refers to the height of a typeface’s flat capital letters (such as M or I) measured from the baseline. Round and pointed capital letters, such as S and A, are optically adjusted by being drawn with a slight overshoot above the cap height to achieve the effect of being the same size. Every typeface has a unique cap height.
## X-height
- **X-height** refers to the height of the lowercase x for a typeface, and it indicates how tall or short each glyph in a typeface will be.
- Typefaces with tall x-heights have better legibility at small font sizes, as the white space within each letter is more legible.
## Serif

## Letter Spacing
- **Letter-spacing**, also called tracking, refers to the uniform adjustment of the space between letters in a piece of text.
- Larger type sizes, such as headlines, use tighter letter-spacing to improve readability and reduce space between letters.
- For smaller type sizes, looser letter spacing can improve readability as more space between letters increases contrast between each letter shape. Text in all caps, even at small type sizes, has improved readability because of its added letter spacing.
## Baseline
- The **baseline** is the invisible line upon which a line of text rests. In Material Design, the baseline is an important specification in measuring the vertical distance between text and an element.
## Descender & Ascender
- **Ascenders** are an upward vertical stroke found in certain lowercase letters that extend beyond either the cap height or baseline. 
- **Descenders** are the downward vertical stroke in these letters. In some cases, a collision between these strokes can occur when the **line height** (the vertical distance between baselines) is too tight.
## Leading
- Line height, also known as leading, controls the amount of space between baselines in a block of text. A text’s line height is proportional to its type size.
## Weight
- **Weight** refers to the relative thickness of a font’s stroke. A typeface can come in many weights; and four to six weights is a typical number available for a typeface.
- Common weights:  
	1. Light  
	2. Regular  
	3. Medium  
	4. Bold
