# The Usability Concept
Desirable interaction qualities that contribute to Usability:
- Interaction efficiency - task speed;
- Error Rates - volume, frequency, importance
- Learnability - retention between uses
- Subjective Satisfaction

# Experience Factors
- Experience with computation
- Experience in the application domain
- Experience with this or similar applications

# Evaluation Timing
Formative Evaluation:
- during development
- in time to make a difference
Summative Evaluation:
- post-mortem
- serves the purpose of reflection in practice

# Five Usability Evaluation Approaches
- Quick & Dirty
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Design Walkthroughs
- Formal Lab Test
- Field Evaluations

# Methods
No need to know them all, the best way to approach the subject is to know the standard methods that most companies are familiar with.
When faced with a topic to do some research on, instead of considering all of the UX Research Methods, you think "Would any of  the 3 methods allow us to collect the info that we need?".
It is not obligatory to use only a single method in the project that you are currently working on, you can use multiple to achieve better results and coverage.
### Standard Methods
- In-Depth Interviews
- Surveys
- Usability Tests

## In-Depth Interviews
Great way to capture **qualitative insights**. 
Speaking to people and explore their perspective, you'll have this info that can be analyzed and distilled to then share with your team members.
With this interviews you are observing verbal as well as nonverbal cues, teasing out information that may be difficult to articulate.
Usually there is a **script** with questions but this method offers some ***leeway to improvise and adjust*** some of the questions according to what the interviewee is saying.
### Pros and Cons
- Pros:
	- in-depth insights
	- open-ended questions
	- detailed responses
- Cons:
	- can be time-consuming (and expensive)
	- risk of leading questions influencing responses
**!!Best when in early stages!!**
