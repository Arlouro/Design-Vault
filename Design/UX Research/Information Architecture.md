# What Is Information Architecture
Also known as IA, **Information Architecture** is the process by which content is organized and made readily available to users.

## Information Architecture vs. UX Design
Whilst similar to UX Design, Information Architecture is a different concept that focuses on organizing and structuring content to make it easily accessible, while UX Design is broader, focusing on creating a positive and meaningful experience through intuitive interfaces and interactions.
UX deliverables like sitemaps, hierarchies, navigation and metadata are all influenced by Information Architecture.

## Advantages of Information Architecture
- **Improving site navigation**
- **Enhancing user engagement**
- **Facilitate user interactions**
- **Makes a cleaner and better looking website**
- **Increase conversion rates:** New users can more easily find the information they need, and purchases can be streamlined. 
- **Reinforce credibility:** A clean and well-organized website increases consumer confidence. 
- **Improve productivity:** Employees know where different types of content belong and can more readily build out new pages as necessary.
- **Boost SEO:** Good site-level organization is a key factor in search engines’ algorithmic rankings. 
- **Reduce customer service costs:** Users can better troubleshoot their problems when a website surfaces the right information to them at the right time.
