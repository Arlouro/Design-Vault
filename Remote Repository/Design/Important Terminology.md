# Design Terminology

**Onboarding** → These screens typically provide a brief introduction to the app’s features, functionality, and key benefits to help new users understand how to use the app effectively. They are often presented as a series of slides or cards that guide users through the main aspects of the app.

**Parallax** → 

**User-Centered Design (UCD)** → is a design philosophy and process that places the needs, wants, and limitations of end users at the forefront of every stage of the design and development process. This approach ensures that the final product is highly usable and tailored to the target audience. Here are some key UCD methods with examples:

1. **User Research**:
   - **Interviews**: Conducting one-on-one interviews with users to understand their needs, pain points, and preferences.
     - *Example*: Interviewing teachers to understand their needs for an educational app.
   - **Surveys and Questionnaires**: Distributing surveys to a broader audience to gather quantitative data on user preferences and behaviors.
     - *Example*: Surveying smartphone users to find out the most desired features in a new app.
   - **Field Studies**: Observing users in their natural environment to see how they interact with existing products or systems.
     - *Example*: Observing nurses in a hospital to understand how they use medical software.

2. **Personas**:
   - Creating fictional characters that represent the different user types for a product.
     - *Example*: Developing personas like "Tech-Savvy Tom" and "Non-Tech-Savvy Nancy" to guide the design of a new tablet interface.

3. **Scenarios and Use Cases**:
   - Describing specific situations in which a persona would interact with the product.
     - *Example*: Writing a scenario where "Busy Mom Brenda" uses a grocery delivery app to order food while managing her kids.

4. **Prototyping**:
   - **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: Creating simple, often hand-drawn sketches or wireframes to visualize the layout and basic interactions.
     - *Example*: Sketching a basic layout of a new website to gather initial feedback on its structure.
   - **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: Developing more detailed and interactive versions of the design, often using digital tools.
     - *Example*: Using software like Sketch or Figma to create a clickable prototype of a mobile app.

5. **Usability Testing**:
   - Conducting tests where real users perform specific tasks with the prototype to identify usability issues.
     - *Example*: Asking participants to complete a booking process on a travel website and observing where they encounter difficulties.

6. **Iterative Design**:
   - Continuously refining and improving the design based on feedback from user testing and other research methods.
     - *Example*: Releasing a beta version of a software, collecting user feedback, and making iterative improvements before the final release.

7. **Card Sorting**:
   - Having users organize content into categories that make sense to them to help design intuitive navigation structures.
     - *Example*: Asking users to sort features of a new app into groups to inform the app’s menu design.

8. **Heuristic Evaluation**:
   - Having usability experts review the product against established usability principles (heuristics) to identify potential usability issues.
     - *Example*: An expert reviewing a website to ensure it follows Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics for user interface design.

9. **A/B Testing**:
   - Comparing two versions of a design (A and B) to see which performs better in terms of user engagement and satisfaction.
     - *Example*: Testing two different landing page designs to determine which results in higher conversion rates.

### Examples in Practice

1. **Redesigning an E-commerce Website**:
   - **User Research**: Conduct surveys and interviews to understand user shopping behaviors and preferences.
   - **Personas**: Create personas like "Frequent Shopper Fiona" and "Bargain Hunter Ben".
   - **Prototyping**: Develop wireframes and interactive prototypes of the new design.
   - **Usability Testing**: Conduct usability tests to identify and fix any issues with the new design.
   - **Iterative Design**: Continuously improve the design based on user feedback and testing results.

2. **Developing a Mobile Banking App**:
   - **Field Studies**: Observe how people use current banking apps and visit bank branches to understand user needs.
   - **Scenarios and Use Cases**: Define use cases like "Transferring Money on the Go" and "Checking Account Balance".
   - **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: Create a detailed and interactive prototype of the app.
   - **Usability Testing**: Test the app with real users to identify and resolve any usability issues.
   - **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different designs of the account summary screen to determine which is more user-friendly.

User-Centered Design ensures that the end product is intuitive, efficient, and satisfying for users, ultimately leading to higher user engagement and satisfaction.

# Design Measurements

## Text
### Spacing
#### Line Height
- Headings → *Font Size * (1.1 to 1.3)*
- Body Text → *Font Size * (1.3 to 1.5)*
#### Letter Spacing
- Headings → *-1% to -2%*
### Text Width
- Body Text (size 18) → 50 to 75 characters (600 pixels box size)
### Text Alignment
- *Never* have the body and the title with different types of alignment

### Hierarchy
- Stick with ***2***  font sizes
- Use *Font Weight* and *slight changes of color*

## Grid (ChatGPT)
### Desktop (Web/App Design)
1. **Grid Layout:**
    - **Columns:** 12 columns
    - **Column Width:** Flexible, but often around 80-100 pixels
    - **Gutter Width:** 16-32 pixels (commonly 24 pixels)
    - **Margin (Left/Right):** 16-32 pixels or more, depending on the overall design and screen size (common sizes are 80 pixels or 120 pixels for larger screens)
2. **Rows:**
    - **Row Height:** Use a baseline grid, typically 8 pixels
    - **Gutter Height:** 8-24 pixels
### Mobile (Web/App Design)
1. **Grid Layout:**
    - **Columns:** 4 columns
    - **Column Width:** Flexible, often around 60-80 pixels
    - **Gutter Width:** 16 pixels
    - **Margin (Left/Right):** 16 pixels
2. **Rows:**
    - **Row Height:** Use a baseline grid, typically 4 or 8 pixels
    - **Gutter Height:** 8-16 pixels
