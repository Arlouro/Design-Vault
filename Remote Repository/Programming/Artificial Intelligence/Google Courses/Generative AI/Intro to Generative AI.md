# Differences between AI and Machine Learning

**AI:** AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligence agents, which are systems that can reason, and learn, and act autonomously. Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

**Machine Learning:** Machine Learning is a sub field of AI. It is a program or system that trains a model from input data. That trained model can make useful predictions from new or never before seen data drawn from the same one used to train the model. Machine learning gives the computer the ability to learn without explicit programming.

# Machine Learning Classes

Supervised ML Model: Supervised Models have labels. Labeled data is data that comes with a tag like a name, type or number.

Unsupervised ML Model: Don't have labels. Unlabeled data is data that comes with no tag. This graph is an example of the problem that a supervised model might try to solve.
